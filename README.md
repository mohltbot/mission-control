# ArchTrack — Simple Employee Time Tracking

**Know where your team's time goes. Without the enterprise price tag.**

ArchTrack is a simple, private employee tracking system for small businesses. See who's working, what they're working on, and where time gets wasted — all in real-time.

## What You Get

### 📊 Real-Time Dashboard
See your entire team at a glance:
- Who's online and working right now
- What app or website they're using
- How productive they are (0-100% score)
- Total hours worked today
- Suspicious activity alerts (YouTube, social media, etc.)

### 🤖 AI Assistant (Genesis)
Just ask questions in plain English:
- *"Who was most productive today?"*
- *"How much time did Ahmed spend on emails?"*
- *"Who's burning out?"*
- *"What can Sarah do better?"*

No reports to run. No spreadsheets. Just ask.

### 🖥️ Automatic Tracking
Your employees install a small desktop app. It runs silently and tracks:
- Time spent in each app/website
- Project assignments
- Idle time (breaks, away from desk)
- Productive vs unproductive time

**No manual entry. No timesheets.**

---

## Perfect For

- **Architecture firms** — Track billable hours per project
- **Manufacturing** — Office vs floor time visibility
- **Design studios** — Client work vs admin time
- **Any small business** with 5-50 employees

## Quick Start

### Step 1: Deploy to the Cloud (Recommended)

**Option A: DigitalOcean (Easiest)**
1. Create a DigitalOcean account
2. Create a Droplet (Ubuntu, $5/month plan)
3. SSH into your droplet and run:
```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maximizeGPT/Archtrack/main/deploy-enterprise.sh | bash
```
4. Your dashboard is now live at `http://YOUR_DROPLET_IP:3001`

**Option B: Your Own Server**
If you have a server or VPS, just run the deploy script above.

### Step 2: Add Your Employees
1. Open your dashboard URL in a browser
2. Click "Employees" in the sidebar
3. Add each team member (name, department, hourly rate)
4. Each employee gets a unique ID

### Step 3: Install Desktop Trackers

**Currently, the desktop tracker requires manual setup.** Here's how:

On each employee's Mac or Windows computer:

1. **Download the code:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/maximizeGPT/Archtrack.git
cd Archtrack/desktop
```

2. **Install and build:**
```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

3. **Run the tracker:**
```bash
npm start
```

4. **Enter their unique ID** (from Step 2) when prompted

The tracker will start automatically on login and run silently in the background.

**Need help?** The desktop tracker setup requires some technical knowledge. Consider hiring a developer for 1-2 hours to set this up for all employees.

## Common Questions

**Q: Is this spying on my employees?**
A: No. It's transparency, not surveillance. Employees see the same dashboard you do. No keystroke logging, no screenshots, no camera access. Just time spent in apps.

**Q: Will it slow down their computers?**
A: No. The tracker uses less than 1% CPU. Most employees won't notice it's running.

**Q: What if someone works from home?**
A: The tracker works anywhere. Data syncs when they're back in the office, or you can set up cloud sync for remote teams.

**Q: Can employees see their own data?**
A: Yes. Full transparency. They can see their productivity, time breakdown, and compare to team averages.

**Q: What about privacy?**
A: All data stays local by default. No third-party servers. You own everything.

**Q: I have multiple offices. Will this work?**
A: Yes. You have two options:
1. **One central server** (recommended) — Set up one DigitalOcean droplet ($5/month). All employees at all locations connect to it over the internet. Simple, cheap, data centralized.
2. **Separate server per location** — Each office gets its own server. More complex, but data stays local to each office.

For most small businesses, one central server works perfectly.

## Built For Real Small Businesses

ArchTrack was built for my uncle's architecture firm. He needed visibility into his team's time without paying $500/month for enterprise software.

Now he can:
- See who's actually working on billable projects
- Identify time-wasters (YouTube, social media)
- Catch burnout before it happens
- Have data-driven conversations with employees

**No micromanagement. Just visibility.**
