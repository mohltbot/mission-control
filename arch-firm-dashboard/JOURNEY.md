### March 15, 2026 - 5:55 PM PST

**Dashboard Status Review:**

#### Current State
- **Server Status**: Running (PID 77788, started Saturday 11:00 AM)
- **Dashboard URL**: http://localhost:3001
- **Issue**: Dashboard showing "ENOENT: no such file or directory, stat '/Users/mohlt/.openclaw/workspace/arch-firm-dashboard/client/index.html'"
- **Root Cause**: Server looking for static files at `client/index.html` but build outputs to `admin/dist/client/`

#### New Features Implemented (Since Last Update)
1. **Mission Control Dashboard Recovery Script** (`23920680`)
   - Added automated recovery mechanism for dashboard outages
   - Script location: `scripts/mc-dashboard-recovery.sh` (referenced in commits)

2. **Ghost Shift Automation**
   - Continued ghost shift updates at 6:57 AM PST
   - Automated content queue management
   - Lead tracking system integration

#### Bug Fixes & Infrastructure
1. **Path Configuration Issue (ACTIVE BLOCKER)**
   - Server static file path mismatch
   - Current: Looking for `../../client` relative to `admin/server/index.ts`
   - Actual: Files exist at `admin/dist/client/`
   - **Fix Needed**: Update `admin/server/index.ts` static path from `../../client` to `../dist/client`

2. **Production Scripts Operational**
   - `start-production.sh` - Starts server with PID tracking
   - `stop-production.sh` - Graceful shutdown
   - `status.sh` - Check running status
   - `health-check.sh` - Automated health monitoring with auto-restart
   - `backup.sh` - Daily backup automation

- `8cc1a52e` - chore(sync): comprehensive 4-hour update [March 14, 2026 - 7:07 PM PST]

#### Performance Metrics
- Server uptime: ~30+ hours (since Saturday 11 AM)
- Health checks: Running every 5 minutes via cron
- WebSocket: Configured on `/ws` path
- API Health endpoint: `/api/health`

#### Active Blockers/Issues
1. **🚨 CRITICAL: Dashboard Not Serving (Path Mismatch)**
   - Error: `ENOENT: no such file or directory, stat '/Users/mohlt/.openclaw/workspace/arch-firm-dashboard/client/index.html'`
   - Server code looks for: `path.join(currentDir, '../../client')` from `admin/server/index.ts`
   - Actual location: `admin/dist/client/index.html`
   - **Fix**: Change static path in `admin/server/index.ts` line ~29 from `../../client` to `../dist/client`

2. **Zero Activity Data (Persistent)**
   - All productivity metrics still show 0% / 0m
   - Desktop tracker agents not running or reporting
   - No historical data being collected

3. **Report Generation Disabled**
   - Generate Report button requires employee selection
   - No default employee pre-selected

#### Data Status
- **Employees**: 3 configured (Ahmed, Mohammed, Sarah)
- **Projects**: 3 active (Community Center, Downtown Office Complex, Residential Tower)
- **Tasks**: 4 tracked with priorities
- **Activity Data**: None recorded (all zeros)

#### Next Steps
1. **URGENT**: Fix static file path in `admin/server/index.ts`
2. Restart server after path fix
3. Verify dashboard loads correctly
4. Investigate desktop tracker agent status
5. Test report generation functionality
