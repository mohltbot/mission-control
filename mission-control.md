## 🔧 Cloudflare Tunnel Fix Steps

**Status:** 🔴 DOWN (QUIC timeout) — Authentication needed

**Current State:**
- cloudflared is installed (version 2026.2.0)
- Two tunnel processes running but not authenticated
- Error: "Cannot determine default origin certificate path"

**Fix Required (Manual Step):**
```bash
# 1. Authenticate with Cloudflare
cloudflared tunnel login

# 2. This will open a browser - approve the authentication
# 3. Then I can complete the tunnel setup automatically
```

**After you run the above, I will:**
- Create the tunnel configuration
- Set up the permanent tunnel
- Configure auto-start on boot
- Verify connectivity

## 🐛 Budget Tracking Bug Analysis

**Issue:** Tracked $33.49 vs Actual ~$4.50 (7x over-reporting)

**Root Cause Found:**
- Expense #9 in db.json: "$21.85 correction" was incorrectly added
- This was meant to fix under-reporting but was itself wrong
- Actual Moonshot API spend: ~$4.50
- Tracked Moonshot spend: $33.49

**Fix Required:**
1. Remove or correct the erroneous $21.85 expense entry
2. Implement validation to prevent future over-corrections
3. Add reconciliation script to verify actual vs tracked

**Files:**
- `mission-control/data/db.json` (expense entries)
- `mission-control/lib/db.ts` (expense tracking logic)
- `mission-control/scripts/log-expense.mjs` (expense logging)

## 🧠 New Context & Memories

### Rules Learned:
1. **Repo Hygiene at Scale** — Uncommitted changes accumulate quickly; ghost shifts should check and commit
2. **Dormant Pipeline Pattern** — Leads without conversion infrastructure = wasted effort
3. **GitHub Issues Goldmine** — Bug reports are highest-quality leads (users already engaged, pain documented)
4. **Urgency Scoring** — 🔥🔥🔥 Critical bugs > 🔥🔥 Workflow blockers > 🔥 Integration gaps > — Feature requests
5. **GPT-5.4 Codex OAuth Bug** — Systemic issue: OpenClaw calls wrong API endpoint for GPT-5.4 via Codex OAuth, causing 401 errors and silent fallback to GPT-5.3-codex. Affects all ChatGPT Plus users — high-value debugging lead category
6. **Security as Differentiator** — r/selfhosted audience cares about production-ready setups (HTTPS, auth, security) not just "getting it running" — premium service opportunity ($150-300)
7. **Anthropic Migration Wave** — Multiple users getting banned, rebuilding stacks. Migration services and cost optimization in high demand
8. **CVE Content Strategy** — Breaking security news (CVE-2026-28446) offers first-mover advantage. CVSS 9.8+ vulnerabilities drive high engagement and position author as security-conscious expert
9. **Cache Efficiency** — 97% cache hit rate on Moonshot API = extremely cost-efficient operations (~$0.08 per 4-hour sync window)
10. **Ghost Shift Cadence** — Late night (2 AM) shifts effective for repo maintenance without conflicts

### Preferences Captured:
- Conversion infrastructure > lead volume (quality over quantity)
- Week 2 retrospective shows: 16 leads, 0 conversions = broken funnel
- Reactivation priority: Build outreach mechanism before next lead gen push
- **Lead Response Speed** — Strike while iron is hot; 15-hour-old posts are still fresh for Reddit
- **Content Competition** — ClawTank and Markaicode publishing daily; need to move faster and be more specific
- **Landing Page Priority** — GPT-5.4 bug is trending, needs capture mechanism

### Project Context:
- OpenClaw Debugger Week 2: Now ACTIVE — 3 new leads found in Shift 1, 1 security content piece in Shift 2
- Pipeline: 20 leads, $600-3,000 potential revenue
- Next target: 25 leads, 3 content pieces/week, 2 consultations booked
- Conversion rate goal: 10% minimum, 25% on hot leads
- **GPT-5.4 Codex Bug** — Trending issue, potential landing page opportunity: "Fix GPT-5.4 in OpenClaw"
- **Security Checklist Lead Magnet** — "10 Security Steps the Docs Don't Cover" PDF could drive leads
- **CVE-2026-28446 Content Ready** — 7-tweet security alert thread targeting 42,000+ affected users, positions as security expert
- **Ghost Shift 7 Complete** — Repo clean, proactive tasks added, ready for next execution cycle
