## 🔧 Mission Control Dashboard Status

**Status:** 🟡 RESTART ATTEMPTED (Mar 17, 6:57 AM) — Import Error Fixed

**Current State:**
- Import error fixed: Changed `@/lib/expenses` to `@/lib/expense-tracker` in health route
- Server started on http://localhost:3000
- Cloudflare tunnel is running (can route traffic when dashboard is up)
- Health check endpoint `/api/health` should now be available
- Recovery script created: `scripts/mc-dashboard-recovery.sh`

**Fix Applied:**
```bash
# Fixed import error in ghost-shift-work/mission-control/app/api/health/route.ts
# Changed: import { getExpenses, getMonthlySpend } from '@/lib/expenses';
# To:      import { getExpenses, getMonthlySpend } from '@/lib/expense-tracker';
```

**Action Required:**
```bash
# Verify dashboard is running
curl http://localhost:3000/api/health

# If still issues, run recovery script
./scripts/mc-dashboard-recovery.sh
```

**Recovery Script Features:**
- Checks for server directory and dependencies
- Kills existing processes and frees port 3000
- Starts server with health check verification
- Logs output to `logs/mc-dashboard-YYYYMMDD-HHMM.log`
