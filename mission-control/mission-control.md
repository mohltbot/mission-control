## 🔧 Cloudflare Tunnel Fix Steps

**Status:** 🔴 DOWN (QUIC timeout) — Authentication needed since Mar 4

**Current State:**
- cloudflared is installed (version 2026.2.0)
- Two tunnel processes running but not authenticated
- Error: "Cannot determine default origin certificate path"

**Fix Required (Manual Step):**
```bash
# 1. Authenticate with Cloudflare
cloudflared tunnel login

# 2. This will open a browser - approve the authentication
# 3. Then I can complete the tunnel setup automatically
```

**After you run the above, I will:**
- Create the tunnel configuration
- Set up the permanent tunnel
- Configure auto-start on boot
- Verify connectivity

## 🔍 PR #11 Review — Agent Self-Diagnostics Module (ARCHIVED)

**Status:** Ready for your decision (merge/close/request changes)  
**Branch:** `auto-update/bens-bites-self-diagnostics-2025-02-27`  
**Files Changed:** 6 files (+516 lines)

### Summary
Well-structured implementation of Raindrop AI's self-diagnostics pattern. Adds `withDiagnostics()` wrapper, budget alerts, Discord integration, and dashboard widget.

### Summary
Well-structured implementation of Raindrop AI's self-diagnostics pattern. Adds `withDiagnostics()` wrapper, budget alerts, Discord integration, and dashboard widget.

### ✅ What's Good
- **Clean architecture:** Separated concerns (hook, rules, reporter, types, widget)
- **Type safety:** Full TypeScript coverage with proper interfaces
- **Budget integration:** Hooks into existing $200 budget with 70%/90% thresholds
- **Discord alerts:** Critical errors automatically sent to webhook
- **Documentation:** Comprehensive README with usage examples

### ⚠️ Issues Found
1. **In-memory storage only** — Diagnostics lost on restart. Suggest:
   - Add SQLite/local file persistence option
   - Or document this as "session-only" intentionally

2. **Missing persistence wiring** — The `trackSpend()` function exists but isn't connected to actual API calls. Need to integrate with cost-tracker skill.

3. **No tests included** — Should add unit tests for `checkRules()`, `reportDiagnostic()`, edge cases

4. **Widget is placeholder** — Currently shows empty state always; needs API endpoint to fetch real data

### 🎯 Recommendation
**MERGE with follow-up tasks:** The foundation is solid. Create these post-merge tasks:
- Wire `trackSpend()` to actual cost-tracker skill API calls
- Add SQLite persistence for diagnostics
- Create `/api/diagnostics` endpoint for widget
- Add unit tests

### ✅ Post-Merge Update (Mar 2, 2026)
Created standalone `/api/diagnostics` endpoint that provides comprehensive system health checks. The PR #11 widget can be updated to fetch from this endpoint.

**Note:** PR #11 was never merged. The standalone `/api/diagnostics` endpoint was created separately and serves the same purpose. PR #11 can be closed.

## 🟡 My Tasks (Need Your Input)

Tasks requiring manual input, approval, or interactive authentication:

- [ ] **ArchTrack Server Deployment** — Choose deployment option for uncle's employee tracking system
  * **Option A:** Uncle's local server (needs server details)
  * **Option B:** Cloud VPS (DigitalOcean, AWS, etc.) — ~$5-10/month
  * **Option C:** Continue local development on Mac mini for now
  * **BLOCKER:** Needs decision on hosting approach

- [ ] **Persistent Cloudflare Tunnel** — Run `cloudflared tunnel login` manually, then I can complete setup
  * **STATUS:** Still DOWN since Mar 4 — QUIC timeout errors
  * **ACTION REQUIRED:** Execute `cloudflared tunnel login` in terminal

- [ ] **Review SaaS Agentification Framework** — Built for Monta VC portfolio, needs your config input
- [ ] **Domain decision** — Permanent Cloudflare tunnel requires domain setup (optional)
- [ ] **Test v2 workflows** — Validate n8n import for Narada, Newtrul, Avaamo, KlearNow workflows
- [ ] **Fix budget tracking bug** — Investigate expense calculation logic, reset tracked amounts to match actual
- [ ] **ArchTrack Employee Onboarding** — Install desktop tracker on uncle's employee computers

## 💰 Budget Tracking

### API Spend (Current Session: 3:04 AM PST)
| Provider | Model | Tokens In | Tokens Out | Est. Cost |
|----------|-------|-----------|------------|-----------|
| Moonshot | kimi-k2.5 | ~23,000 | ~4,800 | ~$0.04 |
| **Session Total** | — | **~28,000** | **—** | **~$0.04** |

### Cumulative Budget (CORRECTED)
| Provider | Actual Spent | Tracked | Status |
|----------|--------------|---------|--------|
| Moonshot API | ~$5.14 | ~$15.00 | ⚠️ Tracking bug identified |
| DeepSeek | ~$0.50 | $0.50 | ✅ OK |
| Gemini | $0 | $0 | ✅ OK (free tier) |
| **Total** | **~$5.18** | **~$15.50** | ⚠️ Fix needed |

**True Budget Usage**: ~$5.18 / $200 (2.59%) — Excellent

**Alert Thresholds:**
- 🟢 Under $150 — Healthy
- 🟡 $150-$180 — Warning (reduce non-essential usage)
- 🔴 Over $180 — Critical (autonomous work paused)

**⚠️ Known Issue:** Budget tracking is accumulating costs incorrectly. Actual spend is ~$5.18, but tracking shows ~$15.50. Investigation needed into expense calculation logic.
